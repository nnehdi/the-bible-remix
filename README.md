### Form and structure
#### Original Biblical form
Understanding its structure will help you map your new content appropriately. The Bible is traditionally divided into two main sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament.

1.  Old Testament: This section consists of several types of literature: 
	a. Pentateuch/Torah: The first five books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) provide the foundation for Jewish law and history. 
	b. Historical Books: These books narrate the history of the Israelites, including Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. 
	c. Wisdom and Poetry Books: This includes books like Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, which contain poetic and philosophical insights. 
	d. Major and Minor Prophets: These books, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, contain prophecies and messages from God through various prophets.
    
2.  New Testament: This section focuses on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the early Christian Church: 
	a. The Gospels: These four books (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) present the life, teachings, and ministry of Jesus.
	b. Acts of the Apostles: This book documents the early Christian Church and the spread of Christianity after Jesus' ascension. 
	c. Epistles/Letters: These are letters written by early Christian leaders, including the Apostle Paul (e.g., Romans, Corinthians, Galatians) and other authors (e.g., James, Peter, John, Jude). 
	d. Revelation: This book contains apocalyptic visions and symbols, attributed to the Apostle John, addressing the end times and the ultimate victory of God.

### Candidate Topics -WIP-
So Far I come up with the following topics to be included.

#### Post modernist
The reimagined Bible could embrace a pluralistic perspective by acknowledging diverse spiritual traditions and incorporating elements of interfaith dialogue. It could emphasize the importance of personal interpretation, subjective experience, and individual spiritual journeys, encouraging readers to find their own truths within the broader tapestry of spiritual wisdom.
The reimagined Bible could be organized into themed sections or chapters that correspond to different areas of contemporary knowledge

#### History narratives 
Broadening the historical context: The reimagined Bible could include sections or chapters that explore the historical and cultural developments of various civilizations throughout different time periods. This could encompass civilizations from around the world, such as ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, China, India, and indigenous cultures from different continents.

Interweaving narratives: Rather than isolating the biblical stories within a specific cultural and geographic context, the reimagined Bible could intertwine the narratives with historical events and figures from different civilizations. This could showcase the interconnectedness and shared experiences of humanity across diverse cultures.

Including diverse voices and perspectives: The reimagined Bible could feature accounts, teachings, and insights from diverse cultures and civilizations. By incorporating wisdom from different races and ethnicities, it promotes a more inclusive representation of human experiences and spiritual perspectives.

By employing symbolism and metaphor, the reimagined Bible can tackle contemporary themes and issues in a thought-provoking way. These allegories can explore topics such as social justice, environmental sustainability, mental health, or technology's impact on society.

Cultural context and historical significance: Folklore stories carry historical and cultural significance within their respective communities. Providing contextual information about the origins and cultural background of each folklore story can deepen readers' understanding and appreciation for different traditions.



### Biblical canon
In the reimagined Bible, the concept of a biblical canon can be expanded to allow individuals the freedom to choose their own set of books that align with their beliefs and point of view. This approach acknowledges the diversity

Open selection of books: Instead of a fixed biblical canon, the reimagined Bible can provide a framework for individuals to select and curate their own collection of books. This allows readers to explore texts from different religious traditions, philosophical perspectives, and spiritual writings that resonate with their personal beliefs.

Encouragement of critical thinking: By allowing individuals to choose their own set of books, the reimagined Bible promotes critical thinking and personal engagement. It encourages readers to explore various perspectives, critically evaluate texts, and form their own informed beliefs.

Community dialogue and sharing: The reimagined Bible can foster community dialogue and sharing of individual selections. Readers can engage in discussions, share insights, and learn from one another's chosen books. This promotes a sense of community and encourages a broader exploration of spiritual wisdom.

Flexibility and evolving selections: The reimagined Bible can adapt to individuals' changing beliefs and spiritual growth. Readers can update and modify their book selections over time, reflecting their evolving understanding and expanding knowledge.
